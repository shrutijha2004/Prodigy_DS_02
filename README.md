 🚢 Titanic EDA – Data Analysis with Python

 Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python and visualized the insights through professional charts and plots.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic case used in machine learning and data analysis. The goal was to:
- Clean and prepare the data
- Perform EDA and uncover patterns
- Visualize trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Export findings as a professional PDF report

## 🔧 Technologies Used

PYTHON
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Survival by Gender, Class, Age
- Family size impact on survival
- Embarkation analysis
- Pie chart of survival distribution
- Correlation heatmap

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Performed

- Filled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Dropped `Cabin` column due to heavy missing data
- Created `FamilySize` feature
